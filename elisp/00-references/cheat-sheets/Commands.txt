                         Unix Commands and Editors

                A Few Preliminary Words About Unix Commands

                                  [Image]

    * Unix is case sensitive. LS won't work, but ls will...

    * You can get by with a very small number of commands, and look up
      the other ones that you need later on.

    * You should not be logged in as root any more than you have to. It
      is dangerous (e.g. you could delete some important files by
      mistake) and it is not secure (e.g. if you walk away from your
      desk, someone could take complete control of your machine).

    * Everything in Unix is a file (including devices)

    * Most of the commands that the average user uses are the same on all
      Unix systems (e.g. Solaris, AIX, HPUX, IRIX, Linux, ...), but the
      system files and system commands can be quite different in the
      various flavors of Unix. [so while Unix System Administrators argue
      over which Unix is the best, to the average user they all look very
      similar]

    *

                          Top 10 List of Commands

                                  [Image]

 man
      This is the unix help command. To get help you also sometimes need
      to know the command name. For example, you could type

         man passwd



      But you can also do keyword searches if you don't know the exact
      name of the command you want information on, for example :

         man -k password



      The info for these help commands are stored in the"manpages"

 cp
      This command COPIES files. For example

         cp file.dat new.dat



      Or to copy all the files in one directory to the current directory:



         cp ../mydir/* .



      .. means to go up one level in directories.
      . means current working directory. To copy all the files in the
      current directory to another directory:

         cp * ~/filedir/



      ~ will take you to your home directory.
      Note that the above command WILL NOT copy files that begin with a
      "."

 more
      Lets you view a file on the screen, for example

         more file.dat

      (use the space bar to page thru the file). Look also at the cat
      command, which is similar.

 ls
      This LISTS files in a directory. Most often you would type 'ls -l'
      . The "-l" key gives all file details. Also, the -a option will
      show all files that begin with "." Also, "ls -lt" will sort the
      files according to date/time.

         ls -lt | more

      will "pipe" the output of "ls -lt" to the more command, so you can
      view it one page at a time.

 mkdir
      This makes a directory just like in DOS, e.g.

             mkdir newdir



 cd
      CHANGE DIRECTORY, for example

        cd newdir

      Typing just "cd" will take you to your home directory. (note to go
      up one directory do: cd ..) What does this do:

        cd .



 pwd
      Tells you which directory you are currently in (print working
      directory)

 rm
      removes (deletes) a file, e.g.

        rm file.dat

      (you might want to use "rm -i" for safety, which will cause it to
      prompt you before deleting it.). Be very careful here, especially
      with wildcards such as "*". The command:

                rm *



      would erase all files in the current directory (except those
      starting with ., and files you do not have permission to erase).

      The following is an extremly dangerous command. If you have root
      privilege, this could delete all files from the entire machine:

              rm -r /*

      The -r tells it to recursively delete all subdirectories !!

 vi
      One of the original Unix editors. Available on basically all Unix
      machines, so it is important to know the basic vi commands.

 mv
      This moves a file (sort of like renaming it), for example

            mv oldfile.dat newfile.dat



                          Some Other Key Commands

                                  [Image]

 rmdir
      removes a directory

 alias
      If there are long strings of commands that you type often, you can
      create an alias for them. For example,

        alias godir  'cd ~/myfiles/temp'

 Mail
      Standard unix mail program (note that mail and Mail do different
      things sometimes)

 pine
      Menu driven mail program. very handy.

 f77 (or f90 or pgf90 or xlf90 )
      Fortran compiler command. e.g.

         f77 test.f -o test

      puts the executable into "test". To run the program you then just
      type "test" .

 cc or gcc
      c compiler, e.g.

         gcc  myprog.c  -o myexec



 passwd
      Changes your password.

 ps
      Shows jobs running on the system. e.g.

         ps -aef

 jobs
      Shows jobs running on the system. (you can use "kill %1" to kill
      job number 1). You can use "fg %1" to bring job 1 into the
      foreground. (ctrl c will kill current process, ctrl z will put
      current process in background)

 lpr
      Prints a file. To print to the 315 Hammond Postscript printers, use

            lpr -Pps  file.ps



      (sometimes it is lp instead of lpr) (use lpstat or lpq to check the
      status of the print job)

 users
      Shows who is currently on the system. (see also 'who')

 "control" c
      Kills your current job

 "control" z
      Suspends you current job. bg then puts it in the background, or fg
      brings it back into the foreground. "jobs" will display them.

                        Some More Key Unix Commands
   (be careful. some of these commands have no effect if your file system
                            uses AFS or DFS !!)

                                  [Image]

 du
      Checks disk usage, e.g.

         du -k

 df
      shows amount of space left on all the disk drives, e.g.

        df -k

 quota -v
      Shows your quota and your current usage of disk space. Be careful,
      some systems that use afs or dfs might not use this command for
      quotas, so it might give you misleading info. (to check your quota
      on an AFS system, use "fs lq" )

 chmod
      used to change the protection on your files. To not allow anyone to
      read, write, or execute your files, do

        chmod 700 *

      To give other people read and execute privelege do

        chmod 755 *

      Again, be careful, if your system uses DFS or AFS then this will
      have NO effect !

 chown
      This lets you change the ownership of a file, e.g.

         chown joe  file.dat

      where joe is your userid

 grep
      to search thru files to see if the expression 'exp' is contained in
      those files do:

         grep exp file.dat

      You could search thru all the files in a directory using:

              grep exp .

 diff
      This will compare two files and tell you where they are different,
      e.g.

         diff file1.dat file2.dat

 find
      This will search the disk drives for a particular file, e.g.

                find . -name file.dat -print

      will start searching in the current director (.) for a file called
      'file.dat' and it will print to the screen.

 ln
      This is a very powerful and useful command, it lets you create
      links between files, e.g.

             ln -s file1.dat file2.dat

      will create a new file called 'file2.dat' which simply points to
      'file1.dat'. This is also useful for directories.

 which
      Finds the location of an executable file (e.g. which more)

 head
      Shows the first few lines of a file (e.g. head file.dat)

 tail
      Shows the last few lines of a file (e.g. tail file.dat)

 xclock, xcalc, xgraph
      Useful X-windows routines

 nice
      Sets the priority of a job (e.g. nice +6 myjob). The higher the
      number the lower the priority (and the 'nicer' you are to others)

 script
      Turns on scripting to record everything that happens in a login
      session (e.g. script myrecord). If you just type script, then the
      results are stored in a file called typescript. To stop recording
      type 'exit'

 uncompress
      Uncompresses files such as files.dat.Z (e.g. uncompress
      files.dat.Z)

 tar
      archiving utility

                                  Editors

                                  [Image]
 emacs
      A standard unix editor. my prefered choice.

 vi
      A standard unix editor. Available on virtually ALL unix machines.
 Some people use this a lot, others use it just for editing small files
 quickly. (see also vim)

 xedit
      A simple X-windows editor (will not work from a dumb terminal)

                               The vi editor

                                  [Image]
 To start vi :

 vi filename

 where filename is the name of the file you wish to edit.

 A few vi commands

    * h, moves cursor left
    * j, moves cursor down
    * k, moves cursor up
    * l, moves cursor right
    * x, delete character
    * dw, delete word
    * dd, delete line
    * p, put last deletion after cursor
    * u, undo last change
    * i, turn on insert mode (hit the esc key twice to stop)
    * :wq, write file and quit
    * :q!, quit without saving file
    * ctrl f, move forward one page
    * ctrl b, move backward one page
    * /text, will search for next occurance of 'text' (hitting n will
      find next occurence)
    * G, go to end of file
    * 1G, go to first line of file

    *

                                      emacs

                                     [Image]

    * GNU Emacs emacs is an incredibly powerful editor. It is almost an
      operating system. You can do the standard cut & paste, but you could also
      read your mail in it. It can also show two files at once using a split
      screen. Incidentally, I wrote this document (and almost all my documents)
      using emacs.

      emacs can be used in X-windows (you need to understand 'setenv DISPLAY'
      and 'xhost') OR you can use it on a 'dumb terminal'. To run emacs on a
      dumb terminal (or inside a unix shell), you may want to enter 'emacs -nw'
      instead of just 'emacs'.

      emacs relies on 'control' or 'meta' commands. These are intimidating at
      first, but are really quite simple. For example

      ctrl-a

      means hold down the 'Ctrl' key and then hit the 'a' key. This will put the
      cursor at the start of a line. Some commands require you to use the 'meta'
      key. The meta key on most key boards will be the 'Esc' key.

      Once emacs is running you can just start typing. Or you can read in a file
      by tpying:

      ctrl-x ctrl-f

      and it will then ask you to enter a filename.

      The following keystroke combinations are some of the ones

      defined:

      Ctrl-a Beginning Of Line                Meta-b Backward Word

      Ctrl-b Backward Character               Meta-f Forward Word

      Ctrl-d Delete Next Character            Meta-i Insert File

      Ctrl-e End Of Line                      Meta-k Kill To End Of Paragraph

      Ctrl-f Forward Character                Meta-q Form Paragraph

      Ctrl-g Multiply Reset                   Meta-v Previous Page

      Ctrl-h Delete Previous Character        Meta-y Insert Current Selection

      Ctrl-j Newline And Indent               Meta-z Scroll One Line Down

      Ctrl-k Kill To End Of Line              Meta-d Delete Next Word

      Ctrl-l Redraw Display                   Meta-D Kill Word

      Ctrl-m Newline                          Meta-h Delete Previous Word

      Ctrl-n Next Line                        Meta-H Backward Kill Word

      Ctrl-o Newline And Backup               Meta-< Beginning Of File

                                  [Image]
 ftp
      Lets you connect to another computer and copy files back and forth.
 (e.g. "ftp brownie.hbc.psu.edu") Once you get connected, you use the
 "get" and "put" commands. You can also type "help" for a list of more
 commands. 'prompt' will toggle prompt on and off. 'mget' will let you
 get a huge list of files (multiple get). 'bin' and 'asc' will tell it
 whether you are transferring binary or ascii files, respectively.

 telnet
      This allows you to connect to another computer and run programs on
 it. (e.g. "telnet farman.cac.psu.edu") For security reasons, most people
 use ssh instead of telnet now.

 setenv DISPLAY
      This command is crucial for using Xwindows. When you use telnet to
 connect to a remote computer, you have to telnet that computer where to
 display the Xwindows. That is what this command does. (e.g.

    setenv DISPLAY farman.cac.psu.edu:0

 The ":0" tells it to use monitor number 0. In this example, farman is
 the machine you are physically sitting at. On the local machine you may
 also have to type

    xhost remote-machine-name

 which lets the other machine (named remote-machine name) send images to
 your machine.

 xhost
      this command lets you control what other computers can send
 Xwindows images to your computer. It is used as: "xhost
 cupcake.hbc.psu.edu" (which would give the remote computer (cupcake) the
 ability to display Xwindows images on your computer. The command "xhost
 +" lets ANY computer send Xwindows images to your computer, this is very
 dangerous and a unix/network security problem. You should NOT use xhost
 +

 xfconfig
      As we discussed earlier, this is used to configure your network

 route
      This command lets you add and delete network routes, and gateways

 traceroute
      This will show you what route your packets are taking from your
 local machine to some remote machine, e.g.

   traceroute yahoo.com

                          File Permissions in UNIX

                                  [Image]
 A file is a structure defined by the operating system.
 Typical UNIX files have three types of permissions associated with them:

 read - the contents of the file can be looked at.

 write - the contents of the file can be edited or changed.

 execute (x) - the file initiate a UNIX process

 These are said to be permission bits.

 Permission bits on a file are give two three groups of users relative to
 the owner of the file. These are:

 The user (u) -- the person who owns the file

 The group (g) -- a member of the group that corresponds to the group of
 the file.

 The world (o) -- All other (o) users on the system.

 An "ls -l" of this file looks like:

 -rw-r--r--  1 leous          784 Aug 30 12:42 file.html

 That is,

 r = 4     (i.e. 2**2)

 w = 2     (i.e. 2**1)

 x = 1     (i.e. 2**0)

 so

    rwx = 7

    r-- = 4

    rw- = 6

    rwxr-xr-- = 754

 To use the above codes you use the 'chmod' command. For example if you
 wanted to set a file to the permissions shown above (on the file file.txt)
 for a file called mine.dat, you would do :

        chmod 444 mine.txt

               ^

Unix Command Summary

See the Unix tutorial for a leisurely, self-paced introduction on how to
use the commands listed below. For more documentation on a command, consult
a good book, or use the man pages. For example, for more information on
grep, use the command man grep.

Contents

   * cat --- for creating and displaying short files
   * chmod --- change permissions
   * cd --- change directory
   * cp --- for copying files
   * date --- display date
   * echo --- echo argument
   * ftp --- connect to a remote machine to download or upload files
   * grep --- search file
   * head --- display first part of file
   * ls --- see what files you have
   * lpr --- standard print command (see also print )
   * more --- use to read files
   * mkdir --- create directory
   * mv --- for moving and renaming files
   * ncftp --- especially good for downloading files via anonymous ftp.
   * print --- custom print command (see also lpr )
   * pwd --- find out what directory you are in
   * rm --- remove a file
   * rmdir --- remove directory
   * rsh --- remote shell
   * setenv --- set an environment variable
   * sort --- sort file
   * tail --- display last part of file
   * tar --- create an archive, add or extract files
   * telnet --- log in to another machine
   * wc --- count characters, words, lines

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

cat

This is one of the most flexible Unix commands. We can use to create, view
and concatenate files. For our first example we create a three-item
English-Spanish dictionary in a file called "dict."

   % cat >dict
     red rojo
     green verde
     blue azul
<control-D>
   %

<control-D> stands for "hold the control key down, then tap 'd'". The
symbol > tells the computer that what is typed is to be put into the file
dict. To view a file we use cat in a different way:

   % cat dict
     red rojo
     green verde
     blue azul
   %

If we wish to add text to an existing file we do this:

   % cat >>dict
     white blanco
     black negro
     <control-D>
   %

Now suppose that we have another file tmp that looks like this:

   % cat tmp
     cat gato
     dog perro
   %

Then we can join dict and tmp like this:

   % cat dict tmp >dict2

We could check the number of lines in the new file like this:

   % wc -l dict2
8

The command wc counts things --- the number of characters, words, and line
in a file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

chmod

This command is used to change the permissions of a file or directory. For
example to make a file essay.001 readable by everyone, we do this:

   % chmod a+r essay.001

To make a file, e.g., a shell script mycommand executable, we do this

   % chmod +x mycommand

Now we can run mycommand as a command.

To check the permissions of a file, use ls -l . For more information on
chmod, use man chmod.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

cd

Use cd to change directory. Use pwd to see what directory you are in.

   % cd english
   % pwd
   % /u/ma/jeremy/english
   % ls
novel poems
   % cd novel
   % pwd
   % /u/ma/jeremy/english/novel
   % ls
ch1 ch2 ch3 journal scrapbook
   % cd ..
   % pwd
   % /u/ma/jeremy/english
   % cd poems
   % cd
   % /u/ma/jeremy

Jeremy began in his home directory, then went to his english subdirectory.
He listed this directory using ls , found that it contained two entries,
both of which happen to be diretories. He cd'd to the diretory novel, and
found that he had gotten only as far as chapter 3 in his writing. Then he
used cd .. to jump back one level. If had wanted to jump back one level,
then go to poems he could have said cd ../poems. Finally he used cd with no
argument to jump back to his home directory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

cp

Use cp to copy files or directories.

   % cp foo foo.2

This makes a copy of the file foo.

   % cp ~/poems/jabber .

This copies the file jabber in the directory poems to the current
directory. The symbol "." stands for the current directory. The symbol "~"
stands for the home directory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

date

Use this command to check the date and time.

   % date
Fri Jan  6 08:52:42 MST 1995

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

echo

The echo command echoes its arguments. Here are some examples:

   % echo this
     this
   % echo $EDITOR
     /usr/local/bin/emacs
   % echo $PRINTER
     b129lab1

Things like PRINTER are so-called environment variables. This one stores
the name of the default printer --- the one that print jobs will go to
unless you take some action to change things. The dollar sign before an
environment variable is needed to get the value in the variable. Try the
following to verify this:

   % echo PRINTER
     PRINTER

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ftp

Use ftp to connect to a remote machine, then upload or download files. See
also: ncftp

Example 1: We'll connect to the machine fubar.net, then change director to
mystuff, then download the file homework11:

   % ftp solitude
     Connected to fubar.net.
     220 fubar.net FTP server (Version wu-2.4(11) Mon Apr 18 17:26:33 MDT 1994) ready.
   Name (solitude:carlson): jeremy
     331 Password required for jeremy.
   Password:
     230 User jeremy logged in.
   ftp> cd mystuff
     250 CWD command successful.
   ftp> get homework11
   ftp> quit

Example 2: We'll connect to the machine fubar.net, then change director to
mystuff, then upload the file collected-letters:

   % ftp solitude
     Connected to fubar.net.
     220 fubar.net FTP server (Version wu-2.4(11) Mon Apr 18 17:26:33 MDT 1994) ready.
   Name (solitude:carlson): jeremy
     331 Password required for jeremy.
   Password:
     230 User jeremy logged in.
   ftp> cd mystuff
     250 CWD command successful.
   ftp> put collected-letters
   ftp> quit

The ftp program sends files in ascii (text) format unless you specify
binary mode:

   ftp> binary
   ftp> put foo
   ftp> ascii
   ftp> get bar

The file foo was transferred in binary mode, the file bar was transferred
in ascii mode.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

grep

Use this command to search for information in a file or files. For example,
suppose that we have a file dict whose contents are

   red rojo
   green verde
   blue azul
   white blanco
   black negro

Then we can look up items in our file like this;

   % grep red dict
     red rojo
   % grep blanco dict
     white blanco
   % grep brown dict
   %

Notice that no output was returned by grep brown. This is because "brown"
is not in our dictionary file.

Grep can also be combined with other commands. For example, if one had a
file of phone numbers named "ph", one entry per line, then the following
command would give an alphabetical list of all persons whose name contains
the string "Fred".

   % grep Fred ph | sort
     Alpha, Fred: 333-6565
     Beta, Freddie: 656-0099
     Frederickson, Molly: 444-0981
     Gamma, Fred-George: 111-7676
     Zeta, Frederick: 431-0987

The symbol "|" is called "pipe." It pipes the output of the grep command
into the input of the sort command.

For more information on grep, consult

   % man grep

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

head

Use this command to look at the head of a file. For example,

   % head essay.001

displays the first 10 lines of the file essay.001 To see a specific number
of lines, do this:

   % head -20 essay.001

This displays the first 20 lines of the file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ls

Use ls to see what files you have. Your files are kept in something called
a directory.

   % ls
     foo       letter2
     foobar    letter3
     letter1   maple-assignment1
   %

Note that you have six files. There are some useful variants of the ls
command:

   % ls l*
     letter1 letter2 letter3
   %

Note what happened: all the files whose name begins with "l" are listed.
The asterisk (*) is the " wildcard" character. It matches any string.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

lpr

This is the standard Unix command for printing a file. It stands for the
ancient "line printer." See

   % man lpr

for information on how it works. See print for information on our local
intelligent print command.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

mkdir

Use this command to create a directory.

   % mkdir essays

To get "into" this directory, do

   % cd essays

To see what files are in essays, do this:

   % ls

There shouldn't be any files there yet, since you just made it. To create
files, see cat or emacs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

more

More is a command used to read text files. For example, we could do this:

   % more poems

The effect of this to let you read the file "poems ". It probably will not
fit in one screen, so you need to know how to "turn pages". Here are the
basic commands:

   * q --- quit more
   * spacebar --- read next page
   * return key --- read next line
   * b --- go back one page

For still more information, use the command man more.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

mv

Use this command to change the name of file and directories.

   % mv foo foobar

The file that was named foo is now named foobar

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ncftp

Use ncftp for anonymous ftp --- that means you don't have to have a
password.

   % ncftp ftp.fubar.net
     Connected to ftp.fubar.net
   > get jokes.txt

The file jokes.txt is downloaded from the machine ftp.fubar.net.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

print

This is a moderately intelligent print command.

   % print foo
   % print notes.ps
   % print manuscript.dvi

In each case print does the right thing, regardless of whether the file is
a text file (like foo ), a postcript file (like notes.ps, or a dvi file
(like manuscript.dvi. In these examples the file is printed on the default
printer. To see what this is, do

   % print

and read the message displayed. To print on a specific printer, do this:

   % print foo jwb321
   % print notes.ps jwb321
   % print manuscript.dvi jwb321

To change the default printer, do this:

   % setenv PRINTER jwb321

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

pwd

Use this command to find out what directory you are working in.

   % pwd
/u/ma/jeremy
   % cd homework
   % pwd
/u/ma/jeremy/homework
   % ls
assign-1 assign-2 assign-3
   % cd
   % pwd
/u/ma/jeremy
   %

Jeremy began by working in his "home" directory. Then he cd 'd into his
homework subdirectory. Cd means " change directory". He used pwd to check
to make sure he was in the right place, then used ls to see if all his
homework files were there. (They were). Then he cd'd back to his home
directory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

rm

Use rm to remove files from your directory.

   % rm foo
     remove foo? y
   % rm letter*
     remove letter1? y
     remove letter2? y
     remove letter3? n
   %

The first command removed a single file. The second command was intended to
remove all files beginning with the string "letter." However, our user
(Jeremy?) decided not to remove letter3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

rmdir

Use this command to remove a directory. For example, to remove a directory
called "essays", do this:

   % rmdir essays

A directory must be empty before it can be removed. To empty a directory,
use rm.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

rsh

Use this command if you want to work on a computer different from the one
you are currently working on. One reason to do this is that the remote
machine might be faster. For example, the command

   % rsh solitude

connects you to the machine solitude. This is one of our public
workstations and is fairly fast.

See also: telnet
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

setenv

   % echo $PRINTER
     labprinter
   % setenv PRINTER myprinter
   % echo $PRINTER
     myprinter

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

sort

Use this commmand to sort a file. For example, suppose we have a file dict
with contents

red rojo
green verde
blue azul
white blanco
black negro

Then we can do this:

   % sort dict
     black negro
     blue azul
     green verde
     red rojo
     white blanco

Here the output of sort went to the screen. To store the output in file we
do this:

   % sort dict >dict.sorted

You can check the contents of the file dict.sorted using cat , more , or
emacs .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

tail

Use this command to look at the tail of a file. For example,

   % head essay.001

displays the last 10 lines of the file essay.001 To see a specific number
of lines, do this:

   % head -20 essay.001

This displays the last 20 lines of the file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

tar

Use create compressed archives of directories and files, and also to
extract directories and files from an archive. Example:

   % tar -tvzf foo.tar.gz

displays the file names in the compressed archive foo.tar.gz while

   % tar -xvzf foo.tar.gz

extracts the files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

telnet

Use this command to log in to another machine from the machine you are
currently working on. For example, to log in to the machine "solitude", do
this:

   % telnet solitude

See also: rsh.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

wc

Use this command to count the number of characters, words, and lines in a
file. Suppose, for example, that we have a file dict with contents

red rojo
green verde
blue azul
white blanco
black negro

Then we can do this

   % wc dict
     5      10      56 tmp

This shows that dict has 5 lines, 10 words, and 56 characters.

The word count command has several options, as illustrated below:

   % wc -l dict
     5 tmp
   % wc -w dict
     10 tmp
   % wc -c dict
     56 tmp

Here's a command reference card for some regularly used unix commands, tested on linux but
should hopefully work on most unix command shells. Any additional (non-obscure) commands you
think should be added,or corrections please email me.

A DOS version of this reference card (+2000 resource kit additions) will be coming soon.

 General help
[command] --help - gives syntax for using that command
man [command] - brings up the manual page for the command, if it exists
man [command] > file.txt - dumps the manual page(s) for the command into 'file.txt'
whatis [command] - gives a short description of the command.
help - gives a list of commands (GNU Bash).
help [command] - gives extra information on the commands listed above.

 Viewing/editing/creating a text file
vi [filename] - opens VI text editor, if the file doesn't exist, it'll be created on saving.
 (when inside vi)
  - using 'i' inserts
  - pressing 'escape' and then ':' goes back to command mode.
  - '/searchstring' searchs for 'searchstring' using regular expressions.
  - ':' followed by 'w' writes
  - ':' followed by 'qw' writes then quits
  - ':' followed by 'q' quits.
  - ':' followed by 'q!' quits regardless of whether changes are made.
  - ':' followed by 'z' undos.
pico [filename] - launches the PICO editor for the filename.
more [filename] - shows one screen's worth of the file at a time.
less [filename] - similar to more
cat [filename] | more - works like more, cat concats 2 strings

 General/System commands
su [user] - changes the login to 'user', or to the root if no 'user' is given.
date - shows the system date
whoami - tells you who you're logged in as
uptime - how long the computer has been running, plus other details
w - shows who's logged on, what they're doing.
df - how much disk space is left.
du - disk usage by your login, it can also total up directories.
uname -mrs - userful info about the system
uname -a - all details about the system

 Desktop / X server + client
Switchdesk {manager - gnome, Enlightenment, etc} - Switches your desktop

 What's running
ps - what's running.
ps ax - shows all processes
top - sort of interactive version of ps.
kill [pid] - terminates the named process, which can be name or number or other options.
killall -HUP [command name] - kill a process, running the command specified, by name.
killall -9 [command] - similar to the above
xkill - kills a frozen application in X (gnome,kde etc. desktops), you just click on the
frozen app.


 File system
ls -la - list all files/directories
dir - simple form of ls
cd [dir] - change directory
cd ~ - go back to the home directory
cdup - similar to using "cd ..", go up one directory.
pwd - print which directory you're in.
./[filename] - run the file if it's executable and in the current directory
rm [filename] - delete a file
rm -R [directory] - delete a directory
mv [oldfilename] [newfilename] - renames the file (or directory)
cp [filename-source] [filename-destination] - copy the file from one place to another
cp -R [dir-source] [dir-destination] - copy a directory an all its subdirectories
mkdir [name] - makes a directory.
cat [sourcefile] >> [destinationfile] - appends sourcefile to the end of destinationfile

- zipping/taring
tar -cvzf mytar.tar.gz sourcefilesordir - creates a new tar file, verbose options on, runs it
through gnuzip,f is the filename
tar -xvf mytar.tar.gz destination - extracts a tar file (this example is compressed with
gzip), verbosely, f is the filename
gzip fileordir - compresses a file with gzip.
gunzip file.gz - decompresses a file with gzip.
NB gzip only compresses files, it doesn't collect them into a single file like a tarball
does.


 Searching
locate [filename] - searches the system using an indexed database of files. use updatedb to
update the file database
locate [filename] | sort - sorts the files alphabetically
whereis [filename] - locates an application, such as 'whereis bash'
find [filename] - searches the filesystem as with locate, but without a database so its
slower.
find /directory -atime +30 -print - searches for files not used in the past 30 days.

 Setting up links
ln -s target linkname - creates a symbolic link, like a shortcut to the target directory or
filename.
ln target linkname - creates the default hard link. Deleting this will delete the targetted
file or directory.

 Network commands
dig domainname - retrieves information about a domain, such as name servers, mx records
whois domainname - whois info on a domain
finger user - gives info about a user, their group status, but can also be used over a
network
netstat -ape - lots of info about whos connected to your machine, what processes are doing
what with sockets

 Piping
Piping to another command is straight forward enough:

locate filename | grep /usr/local > searchresults.txt - searches for filename, runs the
results through grep to filter everything without /usr/local in it, and then outputs the
results to searchresults.txt

| runs one application via another, and can be used multiple times e.g. cat /usr/group | more
| grep root | sort
> creates a new file if once doesn't already exist, overwrites the contents of the file if it
does exist
>> appends to the end of the file, and creates the file if one doesn't exist.
< sends everything after this to the application, e.g. ./mysql -u bob -p databasename <
mysqldump.sql

 Permissions and directory listing format
groups [username] - shows what groups the user belongs to
id [username] - shows extended information about a user.
finger [user] - give details about a user.
passwd [user] - changes the password for a user, or without the user argument, changes your
password.
chsh [user] - changes the shell for a user.
userdel [user] - removes a user from the system, use -r to remove their home directory too.
newgrp [group id] - log into a new group.
useradd -d /home/groupname -g groupname - add a new user with the d being the homedirectory,
g the default group they belong to.
groupadd [groupname] - adds a group

Take a look at the users/groups on the system with:

cat /etc/passwd | sort
cat /etc/group | sort

The stuff below is in the man pages also.
The format of passwd is:
username
password denoted by x (use cat /etc/shadow | sort to list the shadow password file)
uid - user identifier number
gid - group identifier number
misc information such as real name
users home directory
shell for the user

The format of group is:
name of group
password denoted by x (use cat /etc/gshadow | sort to list the shadow group file)
gid - group identifier number
list of additional users assigned to the group

Break down of permissions in a directory listing:
-rw-r--r-- 1 mainuser devel 9054 Dec 28 12:42 index.html

The first character indicates whether it is a directory or file (d for directory).
After that, the next 3 (rw-) are owner permissions.
The following 3 (r--) are group permissions
The following 3(r--) are permissions for other users.

After that reads the number of files inside the directory if it's a directory (which it isn't
so it's 1) this can also be links to the file, the owner of the file, the group the file
belongs to, size in bytes, date and time and then the filename.

Chmod and Chown
Owner,group and other permissions can be r,w,x. Translated into their decimal equivalents
(actually octal but...)
owner - read=400,write=200,execute=100
group - read=40,write=20,execute=10

              Read             Write            Execute
    Owner
    Group
   Others

                                                        Mode

So add them up and you've got your user permissions for chmoding:
chmod [mode] fileordirectory - changes the permissions on a file or directory. use -r to
recursively change a whole directory and its sub directories.

e.g chmod 755 myfile.txt - changes the permissions on the file to 755 which is : owner
read,write,execute; group read,execute; other read,execute.

chown [user:group] fileordirectory - changes the user and group ownership of a file or
directory. Use -R to recursively change a whole directory and its sub directories.
chgrp [group] fileordirectory - changes the groupownership of a file or directory. Use -R to
recursively change a whole directory and its sub directories.
